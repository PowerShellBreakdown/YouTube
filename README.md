The goal of these tutorial videos is to teach PowerShell in a concise and practical way.

I learned PowerShell by having a project or task I wanted to automate with PowerShell and I figured out small steps towards accomlishing each bit.

There are tons of information out there about scripting and the PowerShell language, but I wanted to make tutorials and how-to videos from a non-programming perspective.
